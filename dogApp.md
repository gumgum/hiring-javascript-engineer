Dog App
==========================================
We are making a React app that needs to take in 3 dog breeds from the user and request images of those particular dogs using [this dog api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

Your app should have 3 selects populated with the dog breeds requested from the [list of breeds](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list).

Once the user selects all 3, they should be able to click a button "Get dog images" and make a request for each dog breedâ€™s random image from [the breed endpoint (under random)](http://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed)

Your app must wait until all of the data comes back and then return the data together (consider asynchronous code).

Once all of the images have been returned, please display them to the user on the page (wait until you have all of the photo urls before returning them all to the component).

You can submit the app to us in any way you like. Suggestions include your own React app, using Create React App, or a [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io) link.
